## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Enable GitHub Actions**:
   Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with this content:

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ master ]
   
   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
           with:
             channel: 'stable'
         - run: flutter pub get
         - run: flutter build web --release --base-href /flutter_portfolio_v1_provide/
         - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
           with:
             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             publish_dir: ./build/web
             publish_branch: gh-pages
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to Repository Settings â†’ Pages
   - Set source to "Deploy from branch"
   - Select `gh-pages` branch and `/ (root)` folder
   - Click Save

3. **Your site will be live at**:
   ```
   https://<your-github-username>.github.io/flutter_portfolio_v1_provide/
   ```

### Firebase Hosting (Alternative)

1. Install Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
   ```

2. Initialize Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Set `build/web` as public directory
   - Configure as single-page app: Yes
   - Set up automatic builds: No

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   flutter build web
   firebase deploy
   ```

### Netlify Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set these build settings:
   - Build command: `flutter build web`
   - Publish directory: `build/web`
3. Add environment variable:
   ```
   FLUTTER_WEB_CANVASKIT_URL = /canvaskit/
   ```

## Architecture

This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:

- **Models**: Data structures for projects, job experiences, and blog posts
- **Views**: UI components for each section
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management

## Troubleshooting Deployment

- **404 Errors**: Ensure your `--base-href` matches your repository name
- **Blank Page**: Verify you built with `--release` flag
- **Routing Issues**: Configure your hosting provider to redirect all routes to `index.html`
